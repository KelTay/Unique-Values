# Unique Values

This program reads in 20 numbers entered by the user into the console and if the number has not been entered before, it will print a message indicating that the number is unique. Numbers outside the range 10 to 100 will not be accepted, and the user will have to enter another number. After all 20 numbers have been entered, the program prints out only the unique values.
